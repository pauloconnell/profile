React Router App on Glitch
==================================



Profile: Paul O'Connell
------------

React app with class/Stateless Functional Components being rendered via React Router

Using bootstrap CSS




Structure:
app.jsx uses React Router to serve the pages(components) into index.html 

The home page is Profile.jsx, I've added styles and css loaders packages for webpack to run app.css


Note:
The homepage background photo was me on the best day of the season for me this year.

Future project: refactor to pull out some simple design features to be components that are re-used
