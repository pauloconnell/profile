Starter React Router App on Glitch
==================================

This app is a very small scaffold to get you started using React Router for client-side routing, and it's a remix of [starter-react](https://starter-react.glitch.me).

This project relates to video 3 of 5 in the [React Starter Kit](https://glitch.com/react-starter-kit) video series.

Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit files in `app` folder, it contains all the React stuff
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
