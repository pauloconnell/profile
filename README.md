1# React Router App on Glitch

## Profile: Paul O'Connell

React app with class/Stateless Functional Components being rendered via React Router

Using some bootstrap, but mostly just CSS

-Footer is optionally rendered on each page based

###### Structure:

index.html contains the #'main' element where our react app will be.
app.jsx uses React Router to serve the pages(components) into index.html
the header is rendered in app, but the footer is only rendered on some pages directly

The home page is the component Profile.jsx

I've added styles in /components/app.css and css loaders packages for webpack to run app.css

## Homepage:

The homepage background photo was me on the best day of the season for me this year.
Implement state to change color of frontend vs backend technologies inside of onHover MERN

Details:

Near Future items:

-Update layout d3 complete and push to others
-generate new link to tic tac toe game

- refactor to get rid of space bigspace class and use bootstrap

Future:

1. implement paralax scroll on main page
2. store 'card' data in object, then have single implementaion of a row & dynamicly populate row as it iterates over the data

## NEXT:

a) Media querry to replace background image with centered version for mobile screens
b) Horizontal overflow on mobile, get rid of it

c) Update above items
d) About Me MERN section needs to be centered on full screen
e) Full Stack => move Suduko to top
